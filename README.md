# rpaste
A pastebin, made in HTML/JS/CSS. (exists at https://rstar284.github.io/rpaste or https://rstar284.github.io/paste or https://rstar284.tk/rpaste or https://rstar284.tk/paste).
Uses base64 to store the paste, thus making it a no-datastore pastebin :D.
DISCLAIMER: **Links do get big tho, consider using a link shortner.**
