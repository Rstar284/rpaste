# rpaste
A pastebin, made in HTML/JS/CSS. (exists at https://rstar284.github.io/rpaste).
Uses base64 to store the paste, thus making it a no-datastore pastebin :D
DISCLAIMER: **Links do get big tho, consider using a link shortner.**


TODO:
- [ ] Add line count. CSS is weird. JS has alot of security issues.
- [ ] Font selection.
- [x] ~~Theme selection.~~
- [x] ~~Syntax Theme selection.~~
- [ ] More Themes.
- [ ] QR Code gen, for sharing to a mobile phone.
