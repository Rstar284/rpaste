# rpaste
A pastebin, made in HTML/JS/CSS. (exists at https://rstar284.github.io/rpaste or https://rstar284.tk/rpaste).
Uses base64 to store the paste, thus making it a no-datastore pastebin :D.
DISCLAIMER: **Links do get big tho, consider using a link shortner.**


TODO:
Add highlighting like main branch.
Add line count. (should be easy tbh)


Thanks too @Just-a-Unity-Dev for his [extension :D](https://github.com/Just-a-Unity-Dev/rpaster.git)
